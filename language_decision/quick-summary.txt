Quick Summary of Results
-------------------------

Pilot subjects
- Threshold (a) mean => 2.39 (std: 0.15)
- Drift rates (v)
    - SS & US drift rates roughly the same (2.37 & 2.28, overlapping stdev), significantly higher than both CS & CP
    - CP drift rate (1.47) significantly lower than CS 
    - CS drift rate (1.90) in between CP & SS/US 
    - Range => 1.00 to 2.75
- Accuracy
    - Consistently lower for CP (~92%), rest are fairly similar (~99%)
- RTs => need formal tests (has this already been done?)
- Bias (z)
    - No significant differences between different conditions
    - Clustered around ~0.4125, bias towards the lower boundary

Matched Controls
- Threshold (a) mean => 1.98 (std: 0.125)
- Drift rates (v)
    - Drift rate for CP (0.63) significantly lower than SS (1.59) & US (1.82), but not significantly different from CS (1.27)
    - Range => -0.4 to 2.8
- Accuracy 
    - Consistently lower for CP (~71%), highest for US (~97%), roughly the same for SS & CS (~90%)
- RTs => need formal tests, but generally not too different from pilot
- Bias (z)
    - Clear bias towards upper boundary for SS clustered around ~0.58, significantly higher than all other conditions
    - All other conditions biased towards lower boundary, clustered around ~0.42

Patients
- Threshold (a) mean => 2.64 (std: 0.24)
- Drift rates (v)
    - SS (0.84) significantly higher than CS (0.026) & CP (0.05)
    - US (0.38) not significantly different from any group, in between SS & CP/CS drift rates 
    - Range => -1.0 to 1.75
- Accuracy
    - Low for all groups but particularly CP (~55%) & CS (~57%), with SS (~82%) being highest
- RTs => need formal tests but generally higher than controls & pilot
- Bias (z)
    - Bias for all conditions favours the lower boundary
    - CS & SS bias furthest away, with CS significantly lower
  
    
Overall 
- Drift rates for patients tend to be lower than controls / pilot
- Drift rates for CP, CS & US particularly low for patients
- Accuracy marginally lower for all conditions in patients; as in controls & pilot CP accuracy is lowest
- Bias tends to favour lower boundary in all groups, but closer to lower bound for patients
