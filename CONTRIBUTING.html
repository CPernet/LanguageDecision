<h1>Contributing Guidelines for LanguageDecision</h1>

<p>This document provides a set of guidelines to ensure the homogeneity of the project's codebase,
rendering the task of browsing through the code (either in scripts or Jupyter notebooks) relatively
straightforward and painless.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>Model development takes place in separate date-labelled notebooks under <code>develop/</code>, which are styled after 
lab notebooks and include both initial attempts as well as step-wise refinements that lead to the final model.
Each notebook should concern a particular, fairly specific aspect of the analysis, so that they do not get too
large (i.e. more than 8-10 code cells per notebook).</p>

<p>The files under <code>language-decision/</code> represent the final model and serve as a report on this project. Only refined
aspects of the model should be included under this directory.</p>

<p>All documentation should go under <code>docs/</code>. This project uses reStructuredText as the preferred file format for 
documentation. These files should aim to describe the more technical aspects of the project, and should include: <br />
- Function descriptions <br />
- Data structures <br />
- Descriptions of additional packages used <br />
- Justification for any assumptions made <br />
- Model evaluation <br />
- Identified limitations <br />
Note that this documentation should <em>complement</em> the accompanying text in Jupyter notebooks - not act as a substitute.</p>

<p>General utilities are found under <code>utils/</code>. </p>

<p>Example usage of various model aspects is found under <code>examples/</code>, and can either take the form of python scripts or
Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<h2>Setting up a Development Environment</h2>

<ol>
<li>Install Anaconda, create &amp; activate a new virtual environment as described in the README file</li>
<li><em>(Optional)</em> To automatically generate python files from Jupyter notebooks every time a notebook is saved,
install the Jupyter post-save hook by running <code>utils/jupyter-config/setup.sh</code>. Note that this script only supports
MacOS and Linux hosts at the moment.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Code Style</h2>

<p>All Python code, including code found in Jupyter notebooks, should adhere to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8 style guide</a>,
particularly with regards to the naming convention. </p>

<p>In a nutshell:
- Functions and variables should be all lowercase, with words separated by underscores ("_"), <code>like_so</code> <br />
- No function or variable should consist of more than 3 words - use abbreviations instead <br />
- Constants should be <code>ALL_CAPS</code> <br />
- Classes should use the <code>CapWords</code> convention; for this project, prefer functions over classes <br />
- Modules should have short, all lowercase names  </p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Code in Jupyter notebooks should follow a logical structure, and should always be accompanied by explanatory text, 
ideally both before and after a particular analysis (that produces output).</p>

<p>Technical documentation should go under <code>docs/</code>, to avoid jeopardising clarity in individual Jupyter notebooks.</p>
